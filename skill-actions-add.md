# Adding an actions skill 
{: #skill-actions-add}

Add an actions skill to design a content-rich dialog for your assistant.
{: shortdesc}

## Add the actions skill
{: #skill-actions-add-task}

An actions skill contains actions that represent the tasks you want your assistant to help your customers with.

Each action contains a series of steps that represent individual exchanges with a customer. Building the conversation that your assistant has with your customers is fundamentally about deciding which steps, or which user interactions, are required to complete an action. After you identify the list of steps, you can then focus on writing engaging content to turn each interaction into a positive experience for your customer.

To add an actions skill, complete the following steps:

1.  From the assistant where you want to add the skill, click **Add an actions or dialog skill**.

1.  Take one of the following actions:

    - To create a new actions skill, stay on the *Create skill* tab.

    - To add the actions sample skill that is provided with the product as a starting point for your own skill or as an example to explore before you create one yourself, open the *Use sample skill* tab, and then click the sample labeled **TYPE: Actions**. You can skip the remaining steps.

    - To add an actions skill that was downloaded previously to this service instance, you can upload it as a JSON file. Open the *Upload skill* tab. Drag a file or click **Drag and drop file here or click to select a file** and select the actions skill JSON file you want to upload.

      The uploaded JSON file must use UTF-8 encoding, without byte order mark (BOM) encoding. The JSON cannot contain tabs, newlines, or carriage returns.

      Click **Upload**.

    - If you have created an actions skill already, the *Add existing skill* tab is displayed, and you can click to add an existing skill.

1.  Specify the details for the skill:

    - **Name**: A name no more than 64 characters in length. A name is required.
    - **Description**: An optional description no more than 128 characters in length.
    - **Language**: The language of the user input the skill will be trained to understand. The default value is English.

      For more information about supported languages, see [Supported languages](/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-language-support).

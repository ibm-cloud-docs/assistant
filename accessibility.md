## Accessibility features in the product documentation
{: #accessibility-in-doc}

Accessibility features help people with a physical disability, such as restricted mobility or limited vision, or with other special needs, use information technology products successfully.

The accessibility features in this product documentation allow users to do the following:

- Use screen-reader software and digital speech synthesizers to hear what is displayed on the screen. Consult the product documentation of the assistive technology for details on using assistive technologies with HTML-based information.
- Use screen magnifiers to magnify what is displayed on the screen.
- Operate specific or equivalent features by using only the keyboard.

The documentation content is published in the IBM Cloud Docs site. For information about the accessibility of the site, see [Accessibility features for IBM Cloud](/docs/overview/accessibility?topic=overview-accessibility-platform){: external}.

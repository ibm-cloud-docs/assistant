# Algorithms versions
{: #intent-detection}

**Algorithms versions** allows you to choose which version of {{site.data.keyword.conversationshort}} algorithms to apply to your future trainings.
{: shortdesc}

In the **Options** section of a dialog skill, you can choose to use the more stable and fully supported version of algorithms by selecting **Baseline**. This is the latest mature version that you might want to use for your live assistant. Or you can choose **Beta** to preview and test what is coming. The capability in the beta version at any given time is likely to become the baseline version later on.

The baseline and beta versions are labeled with dates such as **Baseline (2022-06-01)** or **Beta (2022-06-10)**. This refers to the release of a specific baseline or beta version. You can consult the [{{site.data.keyword.conversationshort}} release notes](/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-watson-assistant-release-notes){: external} for details of updates made in that algorithms version release.

Algorithm version options are currently available for Arabic, Chinese (Simplified), Chinese (Traditional), Czech, Dutch, English, French, German, Japanese, Korean, Italian, Portuguese, and Spanish. The universal language model uses default algorithm versions.

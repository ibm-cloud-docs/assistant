# *SMS with Twilio* integration reference
{: #commands-sms}

Add action commands to the message `context` object to manage the flow of conversations with customers who interact with your assistant by submitting SMS messages over the telephone.
{: shortdesc}

Learn about the supported commands and reserved context variables that are used by the *SMS with Twilio* integration.

## Supported commands
{: #commands-sms-actions}

Each action consists of a `command` property, followed by an optional `parameter` property to define parameters for commands that require them. The commands that are described in the following table are supported by the *SMS with Twilio* integration.

| Action command | Description | Parameters |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| `smsActForceNoInputTurn` | Forces a new turn in the conversation without waiting for input from the user. The *SMS with Twilio* integration sends a message request with `smsNoInputTurn` in the text field so that you can map this request to an intent in your dialog. | None |
| `terminateSession` | Ends the current SMS session. Use this command to ensure that the subsequent text message starts a new assistant-level session which does not retain any context values from the current session. | None |
| `smsActSendMedia` | Enables MMS messaging.  | `mediaURL`: Specifies a JSON array of publicly accessible media URLs that are sent to the user. |
| `smsActSetDisambiguationConfig` | Configures how to handle the choices that are displayed in a disambiguation list. | <ul><li>`prefixText`: Text to include before each option. For example, `Press %s for` where `%s` represents the number corresponding to a list choice; this is replaced with the actual number at run time.</li></ul> |
| `smsActSetOptionsConfig` | Configures how to handle option response types. | <ul><li>`prefixText`: Text to include before each option. For example, `Press %s for` where `%s` represents the number corresponding to a list choice; this is replaced with the actual number at run time.</li></ul> |

## Reserved context variables
{: #commands-sms-context-variables}

The following table describes the context variables that have special meaning in the context of the *SMS with Twilio* integration. They should not be used for any purpose other than the documented use.

Table 2 describes the context variables that are set from your dialog. Table 3 describes the context variables that you can set by the *SMS with Twilio* integration.

### Table 2. Context variables that are set by your dialog
{: #commands-sms-context-variables-set-by-dialog}

| Context variable name | Expected value | Description |
| --------------------- | -------------- | ----------- |
| `smsConversationResponseTimeout` | Time in ms | The amount of time in milliseconds that the integration waits to receive a response from the dialog. If the time limit is exceeded, the integration attempts to contact the dialog again. If the service still can't be reached, the SMS response fails. |
{: caption="Table 2. SMS context variables set by the dialog" caption-side="top"}

### Table 3. Context variables that are set by the integration
{: #commands-sms-context-variables-set-by-integration}

| Context variable name | Description |
| --------------------- | ----------- |
| `smsTenantPhoneNumber` | The integration tenant phone number that the user is messaging. |
| `smsUserPhoneNumber` | The phone number of the user that is exchanging messages with the integration. |
| `smsUserData` | Data in JSON format to be passed verbatim to the service orchestration engine or Watson Assistant service. This variable is sent only if the session is started from the integration tenant and the data is sent through the REST API. |
| `smsSessionTimeoutCount` | The session timeout value. This variable is sent only if the timeout value is defined through the REST API. |
| `smsError` | When the integration fails to send an SMS message, this variable contains details about the error that occurred.  |
| `smsSessionID` | The globally unique identifier (GUID) for the related SMS Gateway session. |
| `smsMedia` | The `arraylist` of `mediaURL` and corresponding `mediaContentType`. This context variable is cleared at the end of each conversation turn. |

# Calling an actions skill from a dialog
{: #dialog-call-action}

A dialog node in a dialog skill can call an action in an actions skill to perform a task and then return to the dialog. The actions skill that you want to call must be added to the same assistant to which your dialog skill is added.
{: shortdesc}

From a single dialog node, you can make a call to either a webhook or an actions skill, not both. Choose the approach that best suits your needs:

- Call an actions skill if you want to perform a discrete and self-contained action, and then return to the dialog to be ready to address any new user requests. 

  Data that is collected from the user during action processing must be stored as a session variable for it to be passed to the dialog skill.

- Call a webhook if you want to send a request to a web service to complete a task and return a response that can be used later by this dialog. 

  For more information, see [Making a programmatic call from dialog](/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-webhooks). 
  
  The instructions refer to slightly different user interface elements from the ones you'll see, but the overall process is the same.
  {: note}

## Adding a call to an action
{: #dialog-call-action-task}

Before you start this task, open the target action and make a note of the following things:

- The name of the action you want to call. 

  Open the target action. Select and copy the action name text that is displayed in the page header.
- If the action you want to call uses a session variable, and you want to pass a value to the action by setting the session variable value, make a note of the session variable's ID.

  From the *Session variables* page, click to open the session variable. You can see the syntax that is used for the variable name in the **ID** field. Copy the variable ID to the clipboard. 
  
  You also need to understand the type of value to assign to the session variable. If you don't know, check how the session variable is used by the action.

To take an action that is defined in an actions skill, complete the following steps:

1.  From the dialog node, click **Customize**.
1.  Set the **Call out** feature switch to **On**.
1.  Select **Call an action skill**.

    When you add a call to an action, multiple conditional responses are enabled for the dialog node automatically.
1.  **Optional**: If the action you want to call uses a session variable, you can set the value of the session variable when the action is started.

    In the *Parameters* section, add a key and value pair to pass with the call to the action.

    Add the variable ID (that you copied to the clipboard earlier) to the **Key** field, and in the **Value** field, specify the value that you want to set the variable to.
    
    For example, let's say the action has a session variable named `given name`. You can pass the current user's given name (which you asked for and saved to a `$name` context variable) to the action as follows:

    <table>
      <caption>Action call key and value pair example</caption>
      <tr>
        <th>Key</th>
        <th>Value</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>given_name</td>
        <td>"$name"</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

1.  If you call actions from more than one dialog node, change the name of the return variable to make it unique across all of your dialog nodes. For example, you might already call an action and its return variable is called `$action_result_1`, so you can name the new one `$action_result_2`.

    The return variable is a context variable that is automatically created. It stores any session variable values that are created or have their values changed while the the called action is processed.

1.  In the *Assistant responds* section, the condition for the first conditional response is populated automatically with the return variable from the action call.

    The return variable is named `$action_result_1` unless you change the name. 
    
    If any session variables are created or have their values changed by the called action, then they are returned and stored in the result variable as a JSON object. 

    For example, if the action changes the value of the `given name` and `membership status` session variables, the following JSON object is returned:

    ```json
    {"given_name":"Sally","membership_status":"true"}
    ```
    {: codeblock}

1.  If you don't send or change any session variables, you can delete the first conditional response. Otherwise, consider adding a response to show when a return variable is sent from the called action.

    You might want to specify a custom response to show in case the exchange that took place when the action was processed resulted in a change to the value of the session variable that you passed to the action.
    
    For example, let's say that the dialog asks for the person's given name and stores it in the `$name` context variable. The dialog then passes the name to the action as a `given_name` session variable. Then, the action that is called asks if the customer prefers that the assistant use a nickname. The action then replaces the value that was stored in the `given_name` session variable with the nickname that the customer submitted.

    To continue with this example, you might want to address the user by the preferred nickname, now that you know it. You can add a response that says, `Thanks for your business, <? $action_result_1.given_name ?>!` The `<? $action_result_1.given_name ?>` expression extracts the value of the `given_name` session variable that is returned from the called action.
1.  Add a response to show when no return variable is provided as the second conditional response.

    The second response that is added automatically for you has an `anything_else` condition. This response is shown if none of the other conditional responses are displayed. 

    You can delete or edit the conditional responses that are added automatically. You can add more conditional responses and reorder them.

1.  Click **X** to close the dialog node. Your changes are saved automatically.

Test the interaction between the skills. You cannot test from the "Try it out" pane of the dialog skill, nor from the Preview pane of the action skill. You must use the *Preview* button for the assistant. For more information, see [Testing your assistant from a web page](/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-deploy-web-link).

## When to call an action from a dialog skill
{: dialog-call-action-when}

You might want to call an action from a dialog in the following scenarios:

- You want to perform an action from multiple dialog threads. 

  For example, maybe you want to ask customers how satisfied they are with your service at the end of each interaction. You can define a single action to check customer satisfaction and call it from multiple branch-ending dialog nodes.

  In this scenario, you do *not* need to define an intent, such as `#check_satisfaction` in the dialog skill. The action is called automatically. You can think of the call to an action as replacing a jump to another dialog node's response.

- You want to see how an actions skill works. 

  In this scenario, you can pick an intent for the action to handle. If you plan for the action to be called from the dialog skill only, you can spend your time defining the intent user examples for the intent that will trigger the dialog node that calls the action. And when you define the action, you can add one customer example only. Adding one example gives you an action name to call from the dialog skill, but limits the amount of time you need to spend on adding customer examples given that you already added intent user examples for the intent that will trigger the action by way of the dialog node.

## Particpate in the beta program
{: #feedback-beta}

Want to stay informed about new features that will be added to the product? Want to share your feedback about the feature function and direction? Join the beta program!

To request participation in the beta program, you must first create a new {{site.data.keyword.conversationshort}} service instance that you will dedicate to beta evaluation purposes only. *Do not add an existing instance that you are using to do any real work to the beta program.*

1.  Create a free (Lite plan) {{site.data.keyword.conversationshort}} service resource from the [{{site.data.keyword.conversationshort}} ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://{DomainName}/catalog/services/watson-assistant) page in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} catalog.

    The service instance will be created in the **default** resource group, which is sufficient for the purposes of the beta.

1.  After the instance is created, click **Launch tool** to open the {{site.data.keyword.conversationshort}} tool.
1.  Click the **Skills** tab.
1.  From the bottom of the page, click **Request Beta**, and then confirm that you accept the terms and conditions for participating in the beta program.

If you are approved for participation in the beta program, it is the service instance from which you request beta access that is upgraded to include the beta features.

# Enable your skill to improve itself with autolearning ![Beta](images/beta.png)
{: #autolearn}

Use autolearning to enable your skill to learn from interactions between your customers and your assistants.
{: shortdesc}

This beta feature is available in English-language dialog skills only.
{: note}

When customers interact with your assistant, they often make choices. If your underlying dialog skill pays attention, it can learn from these user decisions over time.

For example, when a customer asks a question that the assistant isn't sure it understands, the assistant often shows a list of topics to the customer and asks the customer to choose the right one. This process is called *disambiguation*. If, when a similar list of options is shown, customers most often click the same one (option #2, for example), then your skill can learn from that experience. It can learn that option #2 is the best answer to that type of question. And next time, it can list option #2 as the first choice, so customers can get to it more quickly. And, if the pattern persists over time, it can change its behavior even more. Instead of making the customer choose from a list of options at all, it can return option #2 as the answer immediately.

The advantage of enabling your skill to apply what it learns from observing customer choices is clear. As your skill learns over time, your customers get the best answer more often and in fewer clicks.

To learn more about how this feature can benefit you, read the [Building the complete virtual assistant with Watson Assistant](https://www.ibm.com/blogs/watson/2020/05/building-the-complete-virtual-assistant-with-watson-assistant/){: external} blog post.

Before your skill can learn from customer behavior, it must observe customer behavior. You can give it real user conversation data to learn from by connecting your skill to a live assistant. When you connect to an assistant, the logs from conversations that occur between the assistant and your customers serve as the data source for observation. 

In fact, if you already connected your skill to a live assistant to use the assistant logs as the data source for intent or intent user example recommendations, then you can skip this step. The same assistant that you connect to for recommendations is used to observe customer behavior.

Autolearning uses observations of actions that are made by only your customers to improve only your skills.

## How autolearning works
{: #autolearn-how-it-works}

Autolearn gains insights from the following user action:

- The choice made from a list of disambiguation options that is displayed for an utterance
<!-- The choice made from a list of suggestions that is included with the response in web chat integrations-->

These customer interactions occur in the context of one of the product's built-in integrations, such as the web chat, or in a custom application. To say that your skill *observes* the choices that users make means that it analyzes logs of the exchanges after the interactions take place. It does not mean that the skill watches the clicks that users make within the client-facing app in real time.

When you connect a live assistant as the data source for recommendations, you enable observation. When you turn on autolearning, you put the observed insights to use to improve your skill, which results in a better customer experience.

## Enabling autolearning
{: #autolearn-task}

You can enable autolearning when the following conditions are met:

- Disambiguation is enabled for the skill.

    Disambiguation is enabled automatically for new skills.
    {: note}

- You have at least one deployed assistant that is actively interacting with customers and has accumulated log data that the skill can learn from.

<!--Autolearning is optimized for use with the built-in web chat integration. This integration, in particular, has a *Suggestions* feature which increases the opportunities for users to make choices, and therefore for the skill to learn from them.
{: tip}-->

To enable autolearning, complete the following steps:

1.  From the Skills menu, click **Analytics**, and then click **Autolearning**.
1.  In the *Disambiguation* section, if disambiguation is off, click **Turn on**. 

    You are taken to the *Options>Disambiguation* page where you can click the switch to turn disambiguation On. Return to the *Analytics>Autolearning* page.

    For more information about disambiguation, see [Disambiguation](/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-runtime#dialog-runtime-disambiguation).

1.  In the *Observing assistant* section, click **Select assistant**.

    Choose an assistant that is live, meaning it is deployed in a production environment and is actively engaging with customers. Click **Save**.

    An assistant is selected already if you are using the logs from a live assistant to get intent and intent user example recommendations. The assistant that you connect your skill to for getting recommendations is automatically used. While you can add one dialog skill to more than one assistant, you can only connect one live assistant to a dialog skill to use its logs as a data source. Both features must use log data from the same assistant. For more information about the recommendations features, see [Get help defining intents](/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-intent-recommendations).
    {: note}

    To change the assistant that is used as the source for observation, click **Change assistant**, choose an assistant, and then click **Save**.

    Do not change the assistant without first considering the impact of this change. When you swap the assistant to observe, it changes the live assistant that is used as the data source for the recommendations feature also.
    {: important}

1.  In the *Autolearning* section, click the switch to turn autolearning **On**.

## Tracking the impact of autolearning
{: #autolearn-track}

Review visualizations that illustrate the impact that autolearning is having on the performance of your assistant.

To view the graphs, open the Autolearning analytics page. From the skill menu, click to expand **Analytics**, and then click **Autolearning**.

![Shows the Modifications graph for autolearning](/images/autolearn-modifications.png)

The following graphs are available:

- **Modifications**: Shows the percentage of responses that were modified by autolearning in the selected time frame.

    Click **View modifications** to walk through specific cases that show you how the assistant responded because autolearning was enabled as opposed to how it would have responded had autolearning not been enabled. You can review the cases to judge for yourself whether the change that was made by autolearning was appropriate and helpful or not.
- **Single answer percentage**: Shows the number of times your assistant was able to answer a customer's question with a single response.

    The goal of autolearning is to limit the effort that a customer has to expend to reach the best answer. As autolearning observes user behavior, it learns about which answer is most often the best. First, it moves the best answer to the top of the disambiguation list. Next, it reduces the number of other options in the list. Ultimately, it is able to replace the disambiguation list entirely with the single, best answer. The higher the percentage of single answers, the better.
- **Average list length**: Shows the number of options that were shown in a disambiguation list. The lower the number of options, the better because it means that your customer was able to expend less effort to find the best answer.

### Using Python notebooks to track customer effort
{: #autolearn-track-via-notebooks}

For more in-depth analysis of the impact that autolearning has over time, you can use the **Customer Effort Analysis Notebook**. The notebook analyzes a metric called *Customer Effort*, which captures the effort that your customers must expend to get an answer to a question or find the solution to a problem.

You can use the notebook from [GitHub](https://github.com/watson-developer-cloud/assistant-improve-recommendations-notebook/blob/master/notebook/Customer%20Effort%20Notebook.ipynb){: external}<!-- or use the notebook with Watson Studio-->.

For more information about this notebook and others that you can use to improve your assistant, see [Jupyter notebooks](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-logs-resources#logs-resources-jupyter-notebooks).

## Learning from your data
{: #autolearn-data}

Observations are made of only your customers` choices to improve only your skills. These observations are not reused by IBM or shared in any way.

This observed user choices data is separate from the log data for which metrics are displayed in the Analytics page. The observation data is also separate from the information that is collected in all but Enterprise plan service instances and used by IBM for general service improvements. You can opt out of such use by specifying an opt-out header in your `/message` API requests. For more information, see [Opting out of logging](/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-information-security#information-security-log-opt-out).

You can limit how the service uses your data to improve your assistant in the following ways:

- To prevent your own skill from applying what it learns by observing user choices to your skill, you must turn off the autolearning feature.
- To prevent your skill from observing user choices, disconnect the live assistant from the skill. 

    Don't disconnect a live assistant if its logs are being used as the source of intent and intent user example recommendations.

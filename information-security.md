## Labeling and deleting data in {{site.data.keyword.conversationshort}}
{: #gdpr-wa}

Do not add personal data to the training data (entities and intents, including user examples) that you create.

**Note:** Experimental and beta features are not intended for use with a production environment and therefore are not guaranteed to function as expected when labeling and deleting data. Experimental and beta features should not be used when implementing a solution that requires the labeling and deletion of data.

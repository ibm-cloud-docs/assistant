## Supported commands
{: #commands-voice-actions}

Each action consists of a `command` property, followed by an optional `parameter` property to define parameters for commands that require them. The commands that are described in the following table are supported by the phone integration.

| Action command | Description | Parameters |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| `vgwActCollectDTMF` | Instructs the voice integration to collect dual-tone multi-frequency signaling (DTMF) input. |  <ul><li> `dtmfTermKey`: The DTMF termination key, which signals the end of DTMF input. For example, "`#`". </li><li> `dtmfCount`: The number of DTMF digits to collect.</li><li>`dtmfMinCount`: The minimum number of DTMF digits to collect when you configure your DTMF collection to accept a range of entries.</li><li>`dtmfMaxCount`: The maximum number of DTMF digits to collect when you configure your DTMF collection to accept a range of entries. After this number of digits is collected, a conversation turn is initiated.</li><li>`dtmfInterDigitTimeoutCount`: The amount of time in milliseconds to wait for a new DTMF digit after a DTMF digit is received. During an active DTMF collection, this timeout activates when the first DTMF collection is received. When the interdigit timeout is active, it deactivates the `vgwPostResponseTimeout` timer. If the `dtmfInterDigitTimeoutCount` parameter isn't specified, the post response timer resets after receiving each DTMF digit, and stays active until either the `vgwPostResponseTimeout` parameter is met or the collection is completed.</li><li>`dtmfIgnoreSpeech`: When set to `true`, speech is automatically disabled on the reception of a DTMF digit until either the collection is completed or a timeout occurs. The default value is `false`.</li><li>`dtmfPauseAfterCollection`: Indicates whether to disable DTMF input after DTMF collection is completed. All DTMF input is ignored until it's reenabled by the `vgwActUnPauseDTMF` action. The default value is `false`.</li></ul> |
| `vgwActDisableDTMFBargeIn` | Disables DTMF barge-in so that playback from the voice integration isn't interrupted when callers press keys. | No parameters. |
| `vgwActDisableSpeechBargeIn` | Disables speech barge-in so that playback from the voice integration isn't interrupted when callers speak. | No parameters. |
| `vgwActDisableSTTDuringPlayback` | Pauses speech-to-text processing before playing back audio, which prevents speech barge-in while the audio plays. After the playback transaction is completed, the voice integration resumes speech-to-text processing. If speech-to-text processing was disabled by the `vgwActPauseSTT` action, it does not resume after the playback transactions are completed unless it's reenabled by the `vgwActUnPauseSTT` action. | No parameters. |
| `vgwActEnableDTMFBargeIn`| Enables DTMF barge-in so that callers can interrupt playback from the voice integration by pressing a key. | No parameters. |
| `vgwActEnableSpeechBargeIn` | Enables speech barge-in so that callers can interrupt playback from the voice integration by speaking. | No parameters. |
| `vgwActEnableSTTDuringPlayback` | Reenables speech-to-text processing during audio playback transactions. | No parameters. |
| `vgwActExcludeFromTTSCache` | Instructs the voice integration not to cache the response from the {{site.data.keyword.texttospeechshort}} service. For example, responses that contain sensitive PHI, PII, and PCI DSS data or dynamic information such as customer names or birth dates should be excluded. <br/>This action tag must be set on thedialog node for each utterance that you don't want to cache. | No parameters. |
| `vgwActForceNoInputTurn` | Forces a new turn in the conversation without waiting for input from the caller. The voice integration sends a message request with "vgwNoInputTurn" in the text field so that you can map this request to an intent in your dialog. | No parameters. |
| `vgwActHangup` | Hangs up the call. | No parameters. |
| `vgwActPlayText`| Plays an utterance string from a list of utterances that are defined in the `output.generic` field. If multiple strings are defined, the utterance is chosen based on the `selection_policy` value. | <ul><li>`text`: An array of utterances. Optional.

The audio file must be in WAV format.</li></ul> |
| `vgwActPlayUrl` | Plays an audio file as soon as the included text is played back, such as for playing music on hold (MOH) or common one-time utterances. If no text is included, the audio is played immediately. The file must be single channel (mono), PCM-encoded, and have a 8,000 Hz sampling rate with 16 bits per sample. | <ul><li>`url`: The URL to play. Required.</li><li> `playURLInLoop`: Optionally set to `Yes` or `No` to indicate whether to play the URL in a loop. The default value is `No`.</li></ul> |

| `vgwActPauseSTT` | Pauses speech-to-text processing until it's reenabled by the `vgwActUnPauseSTT` action. If recording is enabled and speech-to-text processing is paused, the audio from the caller isn't captured. | `participants`: For SIPREC sessions, a comma-separated list of participants that the action is applied to. If the `participants` list isn't provided, the action is applied to all participants or SIPREC streams.|
| `vgwActSendSIPInfo`| Send UUI data in a SIP INFO request. | <ul><li>`sipHeaders`: A paired list of SIP Header names and values, which is added to the SIP INFO request in `name/value` format.

When the timeout occurs, the phone integration sends {{site.data.keyword.conversationshort}} a text update with the word "vgwFinalUtteranceTimeout" to indicate that no final utterance was received. |
| `vgwPostResponseTimeoutCount` | Time in ms | The amount of time in milliseconds to wait for a new utterance after the response is played back to the caller. If this value is exceeded, the {{site.data.keyword.conversationshort}} receives a text update with the word "vgwPostResponseTimeout" to indicate that a timeout occurred.|
| `vgwSessionInactivityTimeout` | Time in min | Inactivity timeout interval. The timeout interval value specifies in minutes how long the phone integration allows a session to be inactive. When the timeout expires, the phone integration ends the session. |
| `vgwTransferFailedAudioURL` | User-defined value. | A URL to an audio file that is played if the {{site.data.keyword.texttospeechshort}} service can't be contacted when the phone integration attempts to play back the vgwTransferFailedMessage message. Configure your dialog to set this variable on the first turn. |
| `vgwTransferFailedMessage` | Text string | If the `vgwDisconnectCallOnTransferFailure` parameter is set to `Yes`, the message that is streamed to the caller if the call transfer fails. You define this message when you set up the phone integration. |
